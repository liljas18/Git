''' Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive 
integer input by a user.  
The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.'''


# The user inputs a number
# The user continues to input numbers until he puts in a negative value
# Then the maximum number the user put in prints out
